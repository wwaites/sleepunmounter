The sleepunmounter program solves a silly problem that shouldn't be.
With an external disk connected to an Apple computer, when the computer
sleeps, the disk is powered down and not cleanly unmounted. When the
computer wakes, an error indicating this appears.

The sleepunmounter must be run as root because the only way to unmount
the disk from within the notification handler seems to be to call the
unmount(2) system call as root, with the MNT_FORCE flag. Running 
diskutil as the user, or as root does not work, nor does unmount(2)
without the flag to force it.

Apple also seems to have decided to outlaw both the daemonize(3) C
library routine and the fork(2) system call making turning this program
into a daemon needlessly complicated. Therefore there is a little 
program called daemonize that does the work.

So, running this in the terminal:

	sudo ./daemonize ./sleepunmounter /Volumes/Something

will cause the sleepunmounter to run in the background and force
unmounting of the disk when the computer goes to sleep.
